If you want to continuously process rows from an Excel file without storing them in a list, you can modify your code to accept an interface as a parameter and process each row as it's read from the Excel file. This allows you to achieve a streaming-like behavior without loading all rows into memory. Here's an example of how you can do this:

First, define an interface for processing rows:

```java
public interface RowProcessor {
    void processRow(Row row);
}
```

Next, modify your `readTeacherExcel` method to accept an instance of this interface as a parameter:

```java
public void readTeacherExcel(RowProcessor rowProcessor) throws Exception {
    try {
        List<Row> rows = excelread.readExcelRow(teacherFilePath, 0);

        for (Row r : rows) {
            rowProcessor.processRow(r);
        }

    } catch (IOException | InvalidFormatException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

Now, you can implement the `RowProcessor` interface to define how you want to process each row. For your specific case, it seems like you want to create and print a `Teacher` object for each row:

```java
public class TeacherRowProcessor implements RowProcessor {
    @Override
    public void processRow(Row row) {
        Teacher teacher = readTeacherData.processExcelRow(row);
        System.out.println(teacher);
    }
}
```

Finally, you can call the `readTeacherExcel` method and pass an instance of the `TeacherRowProcessor` class:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    YourClass yourClass = new YourClass(); // Create an instance of your class
    TeacherRowProcessor rowProcessor = new TeacherRowProcessor(); // Create an instance of the row processor

    try {
        yourClass.readTeacherExcel(rowProcessor);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This approach allows you to process each row one at a time without storing them in a list, making it memory-efficient for large Excel files.
